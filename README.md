## 🎯 Summary

The **OSHE Pick-and-Place** is a low-cost, open-source automated PCB assembly system developed at Michigan Technological University. While industrial SMT solutions are often financially out of reach for small labs and hobbyists, this project provides a modular, 3D-printable framework optimized for performance and ease of assembly. 

The system leverages the mechanical foundations of a Creality Ender 3, extending its capabilities into a dedicated manufacturing tool. By utilizing a vacuum-based toolhead and precision motion control, this project bridges the gap between manual prototyping and industrial production.

### 🛠️ Core Technical Achievements
* **Precision Motion Control:** Migrated to **Klipper Firmware** via Mainsail OS, allowing for higher-speed pathing and web-based machine management.
* **Advanced Toolhead Design:** A custom-engineered 3D-printed assembly featuring full 360° rotation and an integrated vacuum pick system.
* **Expanded Work Envelope:** Features a 370 x 480 mm footprint and support for PCBs up to 250 x 250 mm.
* **Safety-First Integration:** Adheres to **ISO-12100 standards**, featuring dedicated emergency stop (E-Stop) hardware and passive shielding.

### 📈 Current Project Status
The Spring 2026 revision (V2.0) has successfully transitioned the project into a functional integration phase. The machine currently supports SMD components (0804 and larger). Future development focuses on integrating computer vision and automated reel loading.
This project currently exists separately from the OpenPnP architecture. It was not designed around their software suite.
