"""Slice one plate: check it, resolve heights, choose the placement order.

Errors stop slicing (no job file). Warnings are shown but don't stop it.

Placement order (JOB_FORMAT.md: file order = placement order, lowest first):
  1. by height, lowest first, so the nozzle never meets a part already placed
     that is taller than the one it is carrying;
  2. parts of the same height and package together (one feeder at a time),
     smaller packages first;
  3. within a package, a short path: nearest unplaced part next, starting
     from where the previous group ended.
